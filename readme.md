# DTR SMART on FHIR App
This subproject contains a SMART on FHIR app, which provides a standardized way to interact with FHIR servers. This Reference Impementation (RI) supports the **[Documents Templates and Rules (DTR) IG](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-dtr/)** which specifies how payer rules can be executed in a provider context to ensure that documentation requirements are met. This RI and IG are companions to the **[Coverage Requirements Discovery (CRD) IG](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-crd/)** and **[Coverage Requirements Discovery (CRD) RI](https://github.com/HL7-DaVinci/CRD)**.

## Running DTR

You can find a complete end-to-end set up guide for DRLS, including DTR, [here](https://github.com/HL7-DaVinci/CRD/blob/master/SetupGuideForMacOS.md).

# Getting Started

If you are running DRLS for the first time, we highly recommend you refer to our comprehensive [setup guide](https://github.com/HL7-DaVinci/CRD/blob/master/SetupGuideForMacOS.md) for instructions on how to install DTR. Once you have DRLS up and running, you can return here to find more detailed information about how DTR works.

## Prerequisites

Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/HL7-DaVinci/dtr.git`
2. In a terminal, navigate to the directory the project was cloned into
3. Run `npm install`
4. To Run:
	* dev: `npm start`
	* production: `npm run startProd`

The service will run on port 3005. This can be changed in `package.json` and the configuration file for the desired version. The dev version is configured with `webpack.config.js` and does not use `https` by default.  The production version is configured through `webpack.config.prod.js` and does use `https` by default.  This can also be changed in the desired config by changing the `https` boolean.  There is currently no redirection between `https` and `http`, so using the wrong scheme in the url will result in an empty response.

## Using the App
### EHR Launch

Once the app is up and running you can launch it manually by visiting the launch page and including the two required parameters:

|Param|Description|
|----|----|
|`iss`|The base URL of the FHIR server|
|`launch`|The unique ID for this launch|

The FHIR server must properly comply with the SMART on FHIR specification and have a conformance statement with a `security` section that contains the authorization endpoints that the app needs to request a token from.

For example, 
http://localhost:3005/launch?iss=http://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r2/fhir/&launch=1234 is an example of a valid launch url that will successfully launch the app.  Note that the launch id is generally not something the user defines themselves, but rather is generated by the EHR and is automatically appended to the url parameters as part of the launch sequence when clicking on a SMART link.
### Standalone Launch

The app can be launched standalone by omitting a launch id.  Unlike an EHR launch, standalone launches can be initiated outside of an EHR context and don't require the generation of a launch id.  Simply navigate to the launch url and include the `iss` parameter to initiate a standalone launch.

An example url that launches the standalone app is http://localhost:3005/launch?iss=http://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r2/fhir/.  When the app is launched standalone, it authenticates against the EHR referenced by the `iss`, but does not have any context such as patient ID or device request.  Instead, the app will allow the user to select a patient from a list if that patient has an outstanding in-progress questionnaire available.  If there are no in-progress questionnaires in the EHR, the standalone launch cannot proceed.  
## Connecting with other subprojects:

It is recommmended when first starting out you have all five applications running (**[CRD Request Generator](https://github.com/HL7-DaVinci/crd-request-generator), [Test EHR (FHIR) Server](https://github.com/HL7-DaVinci/test-ehr/tree/master), [CRD Server](https://github.com/HL7-DaVinci/CRD), [DTR Server](https://github.com/HL7-DaVinci/dtr),** and **[KeyCloak  Server](https://github.com/HL7-DaVinci/CRD#setting-up-a-keycloak-instance)**) to test the full SMART on FHIR App launch sequence. After getting these applications up and running you can swap in your appliaction if desired.  

_Note: If you have your own EHR then you should not need to run the EHR (FHIR) Server, KeyCloak and the Request Generator. Otherwise please follow the below steps._

Steps to prepare local EHR server, Keycloak server, and Request Generator:

1. Remove the **target** folder (if it exists) in the **Test EHR** server folder.
   
2. Start the **Test EHR** server, by running `gradle appRun`.

3. Make sure the **Test EHR** server has the data it needs, by running `gradle loadData` to populate it.

4. Then, run the **KeyCloak** server. Follow the guide in the CRD readme if you have never set it up before, make the appropriate **realm/client/user**.      

5. Then run the **CRD** server, **DTR** server, and **CRD Request Generator**.

   Note: The DTR app's authorization against the EHR server requires a `client_id` that is registered with the auth server of that EHR to work. The DTR app has a `/register` endpoint that allows user entry of which `client_id` to use for a specific EHR server. If following the KeyCloak guide provided in the CRD readme, the client would be called `app-login`.


>Test it!

>Assuming you have completed the above. You should be able to send a request from the CRD Request Generator in order for the SMART app to launch by clicking the `Patient Select:` button to pre-populate the inputs. Choose a `Device, Service, or Medication Request` from the drop-down for one of the patients, then click anywhere in the row corresponding to the patient for whom you selected a `Device, Service, or Medication Request`. The data will be prefetched and you can send the request by pressing the `Submit` button. You should get a CDS Hooks Card back. Click the SMART link button for `Order Form` and you should see a login screen. Login with whatever user you've registered, and the SMART App should proceed to launch.

## Building Releases

Official releases are built automatically, but you may test the process or roll your own similar to the following:

    docker build -t hspc/davinci-dtr:latest .

To run dev (https=false, port=3005, proxy=http://localhost:8090):

	docker run -it --name davinci-dtr -p 3005:3005 --rm hspc/davinci-dtr:latest
	
To run production (https=true, port=3005, proxy=https://davinci-crd.logicahealth.org):

	docker run -e VERSION='Prod' -it --name davinci-dtr -p 3005:3005 --rm hspc/davinci-dtr:latest
	
To run configurable template:

	docker run -e VERSION='Template' -e PROXY_TARGET='http:\/\/localhost:8090' -e SERVER_PORT='3005' -e SERVER_HTTPS='false' -it --name davinci-dtr -p 3005:3005 --rm hspc/davinci-dtr:latest

The configurable template will use the environment variables passed to the docker run command to replace the `PROXY_TARGET`, `SERVER_PORT`, and `SERVER_HTTPS` values in the webpack configuration file.
